cbrew
=====

A set of bash scripts for compiling and installing C/C++ software packages without root access. It is a little like [linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew), but in my opinion it is much less sophisticated and easier to manipulate.

This project was initially written by [waterret](https://github.com/waterret).
